# Ranker Quick Reference

## 60-Second Overview

**What:** Lightweight product ranking module that orders products by safety & relevance

**How:** Combines dermatological safety, product quality, feedback history, and condition match

**Result:** Top-5 products ranked for the specific user, with explanations

---

## Quickest Start

```python
from backend.app.recommender.ranker import rank_products, UserProfile

profile = UserProfile(
    user_id=user_id,
    allergies="benzoyl_peroxide, salicylic_acid",  # comma-separated
    skin_type="oily",
    conditions=["acne", "blackheads"]
)

ranked = rank_products(
    products_list=products,  # from recommendation engine
    user_profile=profile,
    db=db_session,
    k=5  # return top 5
)

# Results
for r in ranked:
    print(f"#{r.rank}: {r.product.name} (Score: {r.score:.0f})")
    print(f"   Why: {', '.join(r.reasons)}")
    if r.safety_issues:
        print(f"   ⚠️ {', '.join(r.safety_issues)}")
```

## Scoring Components (What Matters)

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Dermatological Safety** | 25% | Clinically tested, suitable for conditions |
| **Product Quality** | 30% | Rating (0-5 stars) and review count |
| **Feedback History** | 20% | How community rated this product |
| **Condition Match** | 25% | How well targets user's detected conditions |

**Final Score:** 0-100 (higher = better for this user)

---

## Allergen Filtering

Products are checked against user allergies through:

1. **Ingredients** - Direct ingredient list matching
2. **Tags** - Product category tags (e.g., "acne-fighting")
3. **Avoid-For** - Conditions to avoid product for

**Result:** Products with allergen concerns are ranked lower (0.9× multiplier) and flagged with warnings

---

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: From Recommendation Engine

```python
# In your endpoint that calls recommendation engine
from backend.app.recommender.engine import RuleEngine
from backend.app.recommender.ranker import rank_products, UserProfile

engine = RuleEngine()
recommendation, rules = engine.apply_rules(
    analysis=analysis,
    profile=profile_dict
)

# Extract product IDs from recommendation
products = db.query(Product).filter(
    Product.id.in_(recommendation['products'])
).all()

# Rank them
ranked = rank_products(
    products,
    UserProfile(
        user_id=user_id,
        allergies=profile_dict.get('allergies'),
        skin_type=profile_dict.get('skin_type'),
        conditions=analysis.get('conditions_detected')
    ),
    db=db
)
```

### Pattern 2: With Strict Allergy Mode

```python
from backend.app.recommender.ranker import RankerEngine, UserProfile

engine = RankerEngine(db=db)
ranked = engine.rank_products(
    products_list=products,
    user_profile=profile,
    k=5,
    include_allergen_warnings=False  # Exclude all products with concerns
)
```

### Pattern 3: Direct Scoring

```python
from backend.app.recommender.ranker import (
    DermatologicalRanker,
    FeedbackScorer
)

# Just score dermatological safety
safety_score = DermatologicalRanker.score_dermatological_safety(product)

# Just score product quality
quality_score = DermatologicalRanker.score_product_quality(product)

# Score from feedback
stats = FeedbackScorer.get_product_feedback_stats(db, product_id, user_id)
feedback_score = FeedbackScorer.score_from_feedback(stats)
```

      ],
      "safety_issues": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Tasks

### Q: How to debug why a product ranked low?

```python
ranked = rank_products(products, profile, db=db, k=10)

# Find a specific product
target = next(r for r in ranked if r.product.id == target_id)
print(f"Rank: {target.rank}")
print(f"Score: {target.score}")
print(f"Reasons: {target.reasons}")
print(f"Safety Issues: {target.safety_issues}")
```

### Q: How to handle multiple allergies?

```python
profile = UserProfile(
    user_id=user_id,
    allergies=[
        "benzoyl_peroxide",
        "salicylic_acid",
        "fragrance",
        "sulfates"
    ]  # as list
)
# OR
profile = UserProfile(
    user_id=user_id,
    allergies="benzoyl_peroxide, salicylic_acid, fragrance"  # comma-separated
)
```

### Q: How to force strict allergy filtering?

```python
engine = RankerEngine(db=db)
ranked = engine.rank_products(
    products,
    profile,
    k=5,
    include_allergen_warnings=False  # Strict mode
)
# Products with any allergen concerns are completely excluded
```

### Q: How to disable feedback scoring?

```python
ranked = rank_products(
    products,
    profile,
    db=None,  # No database = no feedback queries
    k=5
)
# Scores will be neutral (50) for feedback component
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Batch product fetching:**
   ```python
   # ❌ Slow: Query inside loop
   for id in product_ids:
       product = db.query(Product).get(id)
   
   # ✅ Fast: Single batch query
   products = db.query(Product).filter(Product.id.in_(product_ids)).all()
   ```

2. **Cache feedback stats:**
   ```python
   feedback_cache = {}
   for product in products:
       if product.id not in feedback_cache:
           stats = FeedbackScorer.get_product_feedback_stats(...)
           feedback_cache[product.id] = stats
   ```

3. **Set reasonable k value:**
   ```python
   ranked = rank_products(products, profile, k=5)  # Top 5 usually enough
   # Not k=100 which requires scoring all products
   ```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| All products get low scores | Wrong condition/allergy data | Verify user profile data is correct |
| No allergen warnings | Ingredient name mismatch | Check ingredient list formatting |
| Product X ranked last | Many allergen concerns or low rating | Check safety_issues and rating |
| Database errors | Feedback table missing | Ensure RecommendationFeedback model exists |
| Slow ranking | Too many products (100+) | Reduce product list, use strict filtering |

---

## Future: ML-Based Ranking

Currently: **Rule-based ranking** (deterministic, fast, interpretable)

Future: **Contextual Bandit** (learns from user behavior, personalized)

**Benefits:**
- Personalized per user type
- Learns best rankings automatically
- A/B testing capability
- Improves over time

**Timeline:** Phase 2 after rule-based system validated
