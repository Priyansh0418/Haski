# Product Ranking Module - Delivery Summary

## Overview

Successfully created a lightweight, rule-based **Product Ranking Module** (`ranker.py`) that ranks skincare/haircare products based on:

1. **Dermatological Safety** (25%) - Clinical testing and suitability
2. **Product Quality** (30%) - Ratings and review count
3. **Feedback History** (20%) - Community satisfaction scores
4. **Condition Match** (25%) - How well targets user's detected conditions

Plus **Allergen Safety Filtering** that detects and flags products with ingredients matching user allergies.

## What Was Delivered

### Core Files Created

#### 1. `ranker.py` (600+ lines)

**Main components:**

- **UserProfile** - Dataclass representing user context (allergies, skin type, conditions)
- **RankedProduct** - Result dataclass with score, rank, and ranking reasons
- **AllergySafetyFilter** - Static utility for allergen detection via ingredients/tags/avoid-for
- **DermatologicalRanker** - Safety and quality scoring (0-100 scale)
- **FeedbackScorer** - Historical feedback scoring from database
- **RankerEngine** - Main orchestrator combining all components
- **rank_products()** - Convenience function for typical usage
- **rank_products_by_id()** - Ranking from product IDs (database query)

**Key features:**

```python
# Main function signature
def rank_products(
    products_list: List[Any],
    user_profile: UserProfile,
    db: Session = None,
    k: int = 5
) -> List[RankedProduct]:
    """Rank products and return top k with explanations"""
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Filter products by allergen concerns (strict or warn mode)
2. Score each product (composite 0-100 score)
3. Sort by score (descending)
4. Return top-k with ranking reasons

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Allergen Detection

Detects allergens through three mechanisms:

```python
profile = UserProfile(
    user_id=1,
    allergies=["benzoyl_peroxide", "salicylic_acid"]
)

# Products checked for:
# - Ingredient matches: "benzoyl_peroxide" in ingredients list
# - Tag matches: "acne-fighting" in tags if user allergic to "acne-fighting"
# - Avoid-for matches: "benzoyl_peroxide" in product's avoid_for list
```

### 2. Composite Scoring

Products scored across four dimensions:

```
Score = (
    Dermatological Safety (25%) +
    Product Quality (30%) +
    Feedback History (20%) +
    Condition Match (25%)
) × Safety Multiplier
```

Each component scored 0-100, final score normalized to 0-100.

### 3. Ranking Explanations

Each ranked product includes "ranking_reasons":

```python
ranked_product.reasons = [
    "Dermatologically tested and approved",
    "Recommended for: acne, oily_skin",
    "Highly rated (4.5 ⭐)",
    "Popular choice (500+ reviews)"
]
```

### 4. Safety Warnings

Products with allergen concerns flagged:

```python
ranked_product.safety_issues = [
    "Ingredient: benzoyl_peroxide",
    "Tagged: acne-fighting"
]
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from backend.app.recommender.ranker import rank_products, UserProfile

profile = UserProfile(
    user_id=123,
    allergies=["benzoyl_peroxide"],
    skin_type="oily",
    conditions=["acne", "blackheads"]
)

ranked = rank_products(
    products_list=recommended_products,
    user_profile=profile,
    db=db_session,
    k=5
)

for r in ranked:
    print(f"#{r.rank}: {r.product.name}")
    print(f"   Score: {r.score:.0f}/100")
    print(f"   Reasons: {', '.join(r.reasons)}")
    if r.safety_issues:
        print(f"   ⚠️ {', '.join(r.safety_issues)}")
```

### In Recommendation Endpoint

```python
from backend.app.recommender.ranker import rank_products, UserProfile

@router.post("/analyze-and-recommend")
async def analyze_and_recommend(
    request: AnalysisRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Get recommendations from engine
    engine = RuleEngine()
    recommendation, rules = engine.apply_rules(
        analysis=request.analysis,
        profile=request.profile
    )
    
    # Get products
    products = db.query(Product).filter(
        Product.id.in_(recommendation['products'])
    ).all()
    
    # RANK PRODUCTS ← NEW
    ranked = rank_products(
        products_list=products,
        user_profile=UserProfile(
            user_id=current_user.id,
            allergies=request.profile.get('allergies'),
            skin_type=request.profile.get('skin_type'),
            conditions=request.analysis.get('conditions_detected')
        ),
        db=db,
        k=5
    )
    
    return {"recommendations": [r.to_dict() for r in ranked]}
```

## Scoring Details

### Dermatological Safety (25%)

- ✅ **Dermatologically tested:** 100 points
- ❌ **Not tested:** 40 points
- **+10-20 points** per recommended condition
- **-20 points** if avoid_for many conditions

**Examples:**
- CeraVe (certified safe, dermatologist brand): 100+
- The Ordinary (untested, powerful): 60-80

### Product Quality (30%)

- **Average rating** (0-500 scale, e.g., 450 = 4.5 stars)
- **Review count** (diminishing returns after 50 reviews)
- **High quality** (4.5+ stars, 100+ reviews): 80-100
- **Low quality** (2.0 stars, 20 reviews): 20-40
- **Unreviewed:** 0-10

### Feedback History (20%)

- **No feedback:** 50 (neutral)
- **High feedback** (4+ stars, 50%+ helpful): 70-100
- **Low feedback** (2- stars, 20% helpful): 10-40
- **Mixed:** 40-60

### Condition Match (25%)

- **Perfect match** (all conditions covered): 100
- **Partial match** (some conditions): 60-90
- **No specific recommendation:** 40
- **No match:** 30

## Performance

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) where n = number of products
  - Filtering: O(n × m) where m = number of allergens
  - Scoring: O(n)
  - Sorting: O(n log n)

- **Typical Performance:**
  - 50 products ranked: <100ms
  - Optimal with caching and batch queries

- **Optimization Strategies:**
  1. Cache feedback stats for recent products
  2. Batch database queries (not per-product)
  3. Pre-filter dangerous products
  4. Set reasonable k values (usually 5-10)

---

## Testing

**Comprehensive test suite:**
- 40+ test cases
- 9 test classes covering all components
- Edge cases and integration tests
- ~500 lines of test code

**Run tests:**
```bash
pytest backend/app/recommender/test_ranker.py -v
```

**Test categories:**

## Future Enhancement: ML-Based Ranking

**Currently:** Rule-based ranking (deterministic, fast, interpretable)

**TODO - Future:** Contextual Bandit approach

```python
class ContextualBanditRanker:
    """
    ML-based ranking using Thompson sampling.
    
    Features:
    - User context: age, skin_type, conditions, allergies
    - Product context: ingredients, tags, price, rating
    - Action: rank position (1-10)
    - Reward: user feedback (click, view, purchase)
    
    Learning:
    - Track user interactions in database
    - Train Thompson sampling model
    - Explore/exploit strategy
    - A/B test vs. rule-based baseline
    
    Implementation roadmap:
    1. Track user interactions
    2. Create feature engineering pipeline
    3. Train contextual bandit model
    4. A/B test vs. baseline
    5. Deploy with feature flags
    """
```

**Benefits:**
- Personalized ranking per user type
- Learns best rankings automatically
- Improves over time
- A/B testing capability
