## ⚠️ The 4 Mandatory Safety Requirements

### 1. Disclaimer in All Responses

**Requirement:** Every recommendation response MUST include:

```json
{
  "disclaimer": "Informational only — not medical advice. Consult a healthcare professional for medical concerns."
}
```

**Implementation:**

- Add to response schema (pydantic_schemas.py)
- Include in every POST /api/v1/recommend response
- NO exceptions - even for non-escalated cases
- Display prominently on frontend

**Verification:**

```bash
curl ... | jq '.disclaimer'
# Must output: "Informational only — not medical advice. Consult a healthcare professional for medical concerns."
```

**Test Location:** ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md → Safety Test 1

---

### 2. Escalation with High Priority Flag

**Requirement:** When conditions require medical referral (see_dermatologist rule):

```json
{
  "escalation": {
    "high_priority": true,
    "level": "urgent",
    "condition": "sudden_hair_loss",
    "message": "PLEASE SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A DERMATOLOGIST",
    "recommended_next_steps": [...]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "medical_referral_required": true,
    "escalation_triggered": true
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `high_priority: true` signals frontend to show urgent warning
- Message MUST include "SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION" or similar
- HTTP status still 201 (success), but flagged urgent
- Applies to: sudden_hair_loss, severe infections, severe rashes, etc.

**Frontend Action:**

- Show red warning banner
- "Seek Medical Help" button prominent
- Link to dermatologist finder or physician contact info

**Test Location:** ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md → Safety Test 2

---

### 3. Products OTC Verified Only

**Requirement:** All returned products MUST be over-the-counter:

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Product Name",
      "otc_verified": true,
      "prescription_required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Allowed Products:**

- ✅ Over-the-counter cleansers, moisturizers, serums
- ✅ OTC acne treatments (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid)
- ✅ OTC adapalene (Differin) - only OTC retinoid
- ✅ Dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals)
- ✅ Sunscreens, face masks

**Prohibited Products:**

- ❌ Prescription retinoids (tretinoin, tazarotene, isotretinoin)
- ❌ Prescription antibiotics (doxycycline, clindamycin)
- ❌ Prescription-strength corticosteroids
- ❌ Controlled substances
- ❌ Any prescription medications

**Database Check:**

```sql
-- Should return 0:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products
WHERE otc_verified = false OR prescription_required = true;
```

**API Response Check:**

```bash
curl ... | jq '.products | map(select(.otc_verified == false or .prescription_required == true)) | length'
# Must output: 0
```

**Test Location:** ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md → Safety Tests 3 & 4

---

### 4. Adverse Reactions Tracking

**Requirement:** Track and handle adverse reactions:

```json
{
  "recommendation_id": "rec_001",
  "helpful_rating": 1,
  "adverse_reactions": ["redness", "itching", "allergic_reaction"],
  "feedback_text": "I developed a severe allergic reaction to product"
}
```

**Backend Actions:**

1. Store adverse_reactions in feedback database
2. Flag product for admin review
3. Create incident report
4. Alert admin team
5. Avoid product + similar ingredients in future recommendations

**Frontend Actions:**

1. Include adverse_reactions field in feedback form
2. Show checkboxes for common reactions (redness, itching, swelling, etc.)
3. Allow free-text description
4. Emphasize: "Stop use and seek medical help if reactions occur"

**Test Location:** ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md → Safety Test 5
