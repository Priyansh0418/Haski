## 🚀 Integration Steps

### 1. Export to ONNX (for cross-platform use)

```bash
python ml/training/export_model.py \
  --model ml/exports/skin_classifier_best.pth \
  --output ml/exports/skin_classifier.onnx
```

### 2. Export to TFLite (for mobile)

```bash
python ml/training/export_model.py \
  --model ml/exports/skin_classifier_best.pth \
  --output ml/exports/skin_classifier.tflite \
  --format tflite
```

### 3. Use in Backend API

```python
# backend/app/services/ml_infer.py

import torch
import json
from pathlib import Path

def load_classifier():
    model_path = Path("ml/exports/skin_classifier_best.pth")
    class_mapping_path = Path("ml/exports/class_mapping.json")

    # Load model and class mapping
    model = load_model(str(model_path), str(class_mapping_path))
    return model

def classify_image(image_path: str):
    """Classify skin/hair in image."""
    model = load_classifier()
    class_name, confidence, probs = predict(image_path, model, idx_to_class)

    return {
        "class": class_name,
        "confidence": confidence,
        "type": "skin" if class_name.isdigit() else "hair"
    }
```

### 4. Run Inference API

```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 5. Test Inference Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analyze" \
  -F "file=@path/to/image.jpg"
```

## 📝 Files to Use

### For Backend Integration

```python
# Import model loading
from ml.training.train_classifier import load_model, predict

# Load once at startup
model = load_model("ml/exports/skin_classifier_best.pth",
                   "ml/exports/class_mapping.json")

# Use for each image
class_name, confidence, probs = predict(image_path, model, idx_to_class)
```

### For Testing

```bash
# Run inference test
python test_classifier.py

# Run full training again (if needed)
python ml/training/train_classifier.py --data-dir ml/data/training --epochs 50
```
