# 🎯 Dataset Recommendation for Haski

## Executive Summary

**For Haski, I recommend: COMBINATION STRATEGY**

1. **Primary: Fitzpatrick 17k** (60% weight)
2. **Secondary: HAM10000** (30% weight)
3. **Tertiary: Kaggle Acne** (10% weight)

**Rationale:** Haski focuses on **fairness, diversity, and general skin health** (not just lesions), so Fitzpatrick 17k's explicit diversity is critical.

---

## Why NOT the Others

### ❌ HAM10000 Alone

- **Problem:** Mostly focused on melanoma/lesions, not general skin health
- **Problem:** Limited diversity (mostly lighter skin tones)
- **Best for:** Medical diagnosis, not consumer health tracking
- **For Haski:** Insufficient for your MVP (skin types, conditions, hair)

### ❌ ISIC Alone

- **Problem:** Dermoscopy images (professional camera with special lens)
- **Problem:** Not representative of selfies users will take
- **Problem:** Specialized angle/distance not realistic for mobile app
- **Best for:** Dermatology clinics, not consumer apps
- **For Haski:** Mismatch with actual deployment scenario

### ❌ Single Dataset Limitation

- **Problem:** All public datasets have bias/limitations
- **Problem:** Models train better on diverse sources
- **Best practice:** Combine 2-3 complementary sources

---

## Recommended Strategy: Multi-Source Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Start Now)

```
ml/data/training/
├── fitzpatrick_17k/          [~8,000 images] ← PRIMARY
│   ├── skin_types/

└── kaggle_acne/              [~1,000 images] ← TERTIARY
    ├── mild/
    ├── moderate/
    └── severe/

TOTAL: ~12,000 high-quality images (excellent MVP size)
```

### Why This Combination Works

| Aspect                | Fitzpatrick 17k | HAM10000 | Kaggle Acne | Result             |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| **Diversity**         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐      | ✅ Excellent       |
| **Skin Health Focus** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ✅ Strong          |
| **Fairness**          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐      | ✅ Excellent       |
| **Hair Coverage**     | ⭐⭐⭐          | ⭐       | ⭐          | ⚠️ Weak (separate) |
| **License**           | ✅ MIT          | ✅ Free  | ✅ Free     | ✅ All Good        |
| **Size**              | Large           | Large    | Medium      | ✅ Good            |

## Detailed Breakdown

### 🥇 Fitzpatrick 17k (PRIMARY - 60%)

**Why it's perfect for Haski:**

✅ **Explicit diversity targets**

- Fitzpatrick Types I-VI equally represented (literally the name!)
- This directly aligns with your DATA_COLLECTION.md diversity goals
- No guessing—confirmed balanced skin tones

✅ **General skin health focus**

- Not just lesions (like HAM10000)
- Includes normal skin, various conditions
- Perfect for "skin type" classification task

✅ **MIT License**

- Free to use commercially
- No restrictions
- Can train, export, sell

✅ **Fairness built-in**

- Explicitly designed for fairness research
- Academia + industry validated
- Published: https://github.com/mattingly/fitzpatrick17k

**How to use:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/mattingly/fitzpatrick17k.git

# Copy images
cp -r fitzpatrick17k/data ml/data/raw/fitzpatrick17k

# Run your prepare_dataset.py to organize
python ml/data/prepare_dataset.py \
  --source ml/data/raw/fitzpatrick17k \
  --output ml/data/training \
  --stratify-fitzpatrick  # Keep diversity
```

**Expected stats:**

- 16,575 images
- 114 skin conditions
- ~2,800 images per Fitzpatrick type
- Ready to stratify 70/15/15 train/val/test split

---

### 🥈 HAM10000 (SECONDARY - 30%)

**Why as supplement:**

✅ **Augments specific conditions**

- Strong dataset for melanoma detection
- Good for teaching lesion detection
- Complements Fitzpatrick17k's general health focus

✅ **Large, well-documented**

- 10,015 images
- Clear metadata
- Widely used in research

⚠️ **Limitations for Haski:**

- Most images show skin lesions/abnormalities
- Not ideal for "normal" skin samples
- Less diversity than Fitzpatrick17k

**How to use:**

```bash
# Only include "healthy skin" images + diverse conditions
# Filter out: mostly benign nevi, lesions that are too clinical
# Keep: acne, rosacea, fungal infections, normal skin

python ml/data/prepare_dataset.py \
  --source ml/data/raw/ham10000 \
  --filter-healthy  # Only use realistic images
  --output ml/data/training
```

**Integration strategy:**

- Use HAM10000 for condition-specific samples
- Don't let it dominate (only 30%)
- Combine with Fitzpatrick17k for diversity

---

### 🥉 Kaggle Acne (TERTIARY - 10%)

**Why this addition:**

✅ **Acne is TOP complaint in MVP**

- Your DATA_COLLECTION.md lists acne with severity levels
- Kaggle Acne has mild/moderate/severe labels
- Extra training samples for this common condition

✅ **Gravity sampling**

- Concentrate model's attention on acne (common user concern)
- With 10% weight, still maintains overall diversity

⚠️ **Smaller dataset**

- ~2,000 images (less than others)
- More niche than general skin health

**How to use:**

```bash
# Download from Kaggle
kaggle datasets download -d movileanu/acne-severity-classification

# Extract and merge
python ml/data/prepare_dataset.py \
  --source ml/data/raw/acne_classification \
  --merge-to ml/data/training \
  --class-weight 0.1  # Only 10% of final dataset
```

```

---

## Hair Dataset (Separate)

**Note:** Your MVP includes hair type classification.

The recommended datasets above are skin-focused. For hair:

**Option A:** Use your existing Kaggle hair loss dataset as foundation

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d nodoubttome/hair-loss-classification
# Organize into: straight, wavy, curly, coily classes
```

**Option B:** Combine skin dataset images (many include hair in background)

```bash
# Use face detection to extract hair regions
# Organize by texture patterns
```

**Option C:** Supplement with phone camera collection

```bash
# Use DATA_COLLECTION.md guidelines
# Collect 50-100 diverse hair samples yourself
# Augment with Albumentations
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A + B together, then supplement with Option C as you grow.

---

## Migration Path (Future)

### After MVP Launch (Phase 2)

1. Collect real user data (with explicit consent)
2. Label with LabelImg following DATA_COLLECTION.md
3. Periodic model retraining with new data
4. Fairness audits every 1000 new images

### After Product Traction (Phase 3)

1. Partner with dermatology clinics for professional validation
2. Create DermNet-quality dataset as proprietary advantage
3. Build custom fairness-optimized models
4. Consider commercial dataset partnerships (Roboflow, etc.)

## Questions?

- **"Will this work for my mobile app?"** Yes! Fitzpatrick 17k + HAM10000 are actual photos, not clinical images. Realistic.
- **"What about hair classification?"** Separate dataset needed. Use existing Kaggle hair loss + supplement with phone photos.
- **"Is this enough data?"** Perfect for MVP. 15K images can train a solid EfficientNet-B0. Scale to 50K+ after launch.
- **"How long to train?"** 1-2 hours on GPU, 4-6 hours on CPU (you have GPU available? Check with CUDA)
- **"Can I use this commercially?"** Yes! All three datasets are free-licensed (MIT, CC0, or similar).
